N <= 50,000
Max Radius = 1,000,000,000
Firstly multiply all cow positions by two so everything is always an integer.
Read in the cow positions to a TreeSet (fast ceiling and floor function are very useful).
We have two functions, checkLeft and checkRight, that check if exploding from a given starting point with certain radius can reach all the way left or right respectively. Ceiling and floor are used to check the next haybale affected by an explosion with certain radius and starting from a certain haybale.

Run a binary search on possible radii
Then, given the radius, binary search for the starting point
We find the best starting point by testing our radius and start point with checkLeft
If we reach the left, then move up the lower bound. If we don't, then move down the upper bound.
After we finish we know we have the greatest point that can still reach left. We then use checkRight, knowing that if isn't
successful, that radius will never work. If checkRight succeeds, that radius is viable.

We use nested binary searches dependent on max radius and then a simulation nested within that. Floor function is LogN and worst case we traverse the whole line every time checkLeft is called. That should give us (Log(Max Radius)^2)(NLogN). However, almost all of the checkLeft calls end within a few iterations, so the real time complexity should be somewhere between (Log(Max Radius)^2)(NLogN) and (Log(Max Radius)^2)(LogN). The worst test case runs in ~3800ms.
